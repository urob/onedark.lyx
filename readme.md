# onedark.lyx

<a href="img/onedark.png"><img src="img/onedark.png"></a>

A dark LyX color scheme with colors inspired by the excellent [One Dark syntax
theme](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax) for the [Atom
text editor](https://atom.io/).

## Installation

1. Install the theme by replacing the contents of the "COLOR SECTION" in the
   `preferences` file in your LyX configuration folder with the contents of the
   `onedark_lyx_cs` file in this repository.
2. If you have access to a `bash` shell, you can automate the installation with the
   included `install_colorscheme.sh` script by running:
   ```
   ./install_colorscheme.sh onedark_lyx_cs filepath/to/preferences
   ```

## More color schemes

The color scheme was created using
[lyx-colorscheme-brewer](https://github.com/urob/lyx-colorscheme-brewer). Check out the
project for a gallery of all available color schemes.
